### Problema
Model, using Akka, a Web Crawler that:
    • Can scrap data from a site
    • Follow links for each page up to N depth
    • Keeps track of the number of times a url was linked (from other websites)

Note: Domain modeling is the most important thing of this exercise, it doesn’t need to crawl real websites
